1. Our project, when3meet is a tool to help people plan their schedules, make events, and coordinate those events with other users. On the home page, each user has access to a personal calendar which contains all of their events. Each user also has access to the events they are signed up for and their details in list form as well. From the home page, personal events can be added to a user's private calendar.

On the events page, a user can set up events involving more people. The user will have the option to add attendees to events as well as a range of possible dates and times. Other users can then reply with their preferences so that the organizer of the event can finalize the time. Once created, public events are automatically added to all invited user's personal calendars. When3meet is hosted on https://cs4241-final-project-group-7.herokuapp.com/

2. To use the site, first create an account with a username and password and then sign in. The rest is pretty self explanatory.
